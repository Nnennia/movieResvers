Movie Reservation System

There are very expensive pre-made tools that handle all this logic for companies, and the following diagram shows you a glimpse of that complexity.

As backend projects go, this one is a great example of the many different problems you might need to solve while working in web development.

A movie reservation system should allow any user to get tickets and their associated seats for any movie playing the specific day the user is looking to attend. This description alone already provides a lot of features and constraints we have to keep in mind:

    We’re going to have a list of movies (and maybe theaters as well).
    Each movie will have a recurring schedule for some time and then it’ll be taken out to never return.
    Users should be able to list movies, search for them and filter by dates, genres and even actors.
    Once found, the user should be able to pick the seats for their particular movie of choice, and for their date of choice.
    This leads us to you having to keep a virtual representation of your movie theater to understand seating distribution and availability.
    In the end, the user should also be able to pay using an external payment gateway such as Stripe (we’ve already covered this step in the past).
